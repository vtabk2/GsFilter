# PLAN

## Task: MVP Android image filter demo using MVVM

Status: DONE

### Requirements

- Create a small Android Kotlin app.
- Use MVVM.
- Load a bundled image from assets.
- Apply simple image filters without CameraX.
- Split editing controls into two sections: Filter and Adjust.
- Keep the first implementation small and API 24-compatible.

### Approach

- Scaffold one `app` module only.
- Use XML + ViewBinding, matching project instructions.
- Keep Activity as a thin view layer.
- Put UI state and filter selection in a ViewModel.
- Model controls as two categories:
  - Filter: one-tap preset filters.
  - Adjust: numeric image adjustments.
- Render Filter controls from a catalog so more filters can be added without changing Activity layout.
- Use pure Kotlin filter logic where practical.
- Decode and filter bitmaps off the main thread.
- Avoid camera, OpenGL, AGSL, Hilt, and extra architecture until needed.

### Checklist

- [x] Add minimal Gradle Android project files.
- [x] Add app manifest, resources, and XML layout.
- [x] Add MVVM Activity/ViewModel code.
- [x] Add Filter catalog and fixed Adjust CPU processing for asset bitmap.
- [x] Add a bundled asset image.
- [x] Add a small unit test for filter math.
- [x] Run available verification.

### Notes

- Local cache contains Android Gradle Plugin 8.13.2 and Kotlin Android plugin 2.1.10.
- No existing source code is present yet, so this is a new MVP scaffold.
- Filter expansion uses `FilterCatalog`; Activity renders Filter controls dynamically instead of hard-coding buttons.
- `gradle :app:testDebugUnitTest` initially could not run because `gradle` and `JAVA_HOME` were not in PATH.
- Verification used cached Gradle at `C:\Users\TuanAnh\.gradle\wrapper\dists\gradle-8.14.3-bin\cv11ve7ro1n3o1j4so8xd9n66\gradle-8.14.3\bin\gradle.bat` with `JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr`.
- `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passed.
- `:app:assembleDebug` passed.
- Static searches found no `GlobalScope`, `!!`, broad `catch (Exception)`, deleted `FilterPreset`, or old hard-coded filter button IDs under `app/src/main`.
